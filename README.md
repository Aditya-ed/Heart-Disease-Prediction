# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Using machine learning to develop a model for predicting the heart disease and using python flask framework to deploy it to a basic website made with using HTML and CSS.

For the Prediction model I used the dataset provided by Kaggle and did data-analysis on it and applied SVM, KNN, Logistics Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Neural Network.

On comparing their f1_score and the mean squared error I chose the best fit model which was Random forest and using the pickle module of python I dumped the model into a .pkl file.

Using the Flask framework of Python I imported the model and designed different pages as were required and implemented the model using the data collected by the webpages about the user and performed predictions.

There is always room for further improvement. I'm working on to improve the model UI and many more features.
